						<p>Always Do Your Best. Your best is going to change from moment to moment;
						it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. <br> Under any circumstance,
						simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse and regret. </p>

						<p>Being in control of your life and having realistic expectations about your day-to-day challenges are the keys to stress management, <br>
						which is perhaps the most important ingredient to living a happy, healthy and rewarding life.</P>

						<p>I'm concentrating on staying healthy, having peace, being happy, remembering what is important, taking in nature and animals,<br>
						spending time reading, trying to understand the universe, where science and the spiritual meet. </P>
